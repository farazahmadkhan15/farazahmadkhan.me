## Overview

To effectively manage Grey Software's automation processes, I worked on a website that acts as a live dashboard and a technical documentation repository.

## Features

list all the active organization's issues to the dashboard with the options to filter issue based on milestones and labels. Each list shows the complete overview of
issue. ![](https://i.imgur.com/gqvzPqM.png)

Implemented generic functionality to update the remote repository from the dashboard.
